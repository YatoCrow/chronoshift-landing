        <p>In the beginning, there was only the Stillness.</p>
        <p>A silence older than sound, deeper than the void, and colder than the grave. Time did not move. Stars did not burn. No dreams stirred in the darkness.</p>
        <p>From that formless abyss, there came a single pulse, a heartbeat that rippled across the sleeping void. It was called Veyruun, the Primordial Pulse. Neither a being nor a god, Veyruun was existence itself yearning to be. From its throbbing rhythm, the first currents of Time unfurled like silver rivers, threading across the nothingness.</p>
        <p>At first, Time was pure: one great stream, flowing smooth and whole, cradling the newborn stars, stirring the first winds, weaving the first songs.</p>
        <p>But from within the Stillness, not all were pleased.</p>
        <p>One among the ancients, known as Vel'karth, Keeper of the Stillness, watched the flowing river with envy and fear. To Vel'karth, Time was a betrayal, a rebellion against the sacred quiet. Whispering to the dark places of existence, Vel'karth planted the seeds of discord.</p>
        <p>Selviane, the Weaver of Streams, guardian of the single Timeflow, sought to heal the wounds Vel'karth wrought. But she was betrayed, struck down amidst the weaving, and with her fall, Time, beautiful and singular, shattered.</p>
        <p><strong>Thus came the Sundering.</strong></p>
        <p>The great stream burst apart into five fractured currents, each wild and unruly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Night, a realm of endless shadows and longing.</li>
          <li>Full Moon, a land of silver madness and primal callings.</li>
          <li>Day, a golden empire of clarity and dominion.</li>
          <li>Scorch, a searing crucible of flame and rage.</li>
          <li>Dusk, a twilight shore of dreams half-remembered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each phase pulled the world in a different direction, and the harmony of existence was lost.</p>
        <p>From the broken shards of Time, they arose, the Firstborn of the Shards.</p>
        <p><strong>Cindaros</strong>, the Flame That Walks, stumbled from the Scorch, his body a living inferno, his breath a storm of ash.</p>
        <p><strong>Nyxis</strong>, the Midnight Daughter, coalesced from the Night, her form woven from sorrow and secrets, her voice sweeter than memory.</p>
        <p><strong>Raelis</strong>, the Dawnforger, blazed into being from the Day, clad in banners of light, forging songs of order and hope.</p>
        <p><strong>Faelrun</strong>, the Howling Breath, surged from the Full Moon, a beast of silver fur and raw hunger, his howl cracking mountains and rivers alike.</p>
        <p>And far from their clash, in a forgotten corner of the world where no phase raged supreme, there blinked open the pale eyes of <strong>Vulmir</strong>, the Pale Watcher. Born of Dusk, he was a silent observer, a soul shaped not by war or fire, but by the quiet hush between moments.</p>
        <p>While the others raced to carve dominions, Vulmir wandered the forgotten shores, cradled in eternal twilight. Where he walked, the land became soft and muted, untouched by the raging tides of the other shards.</p>
        <p><strong>Yet not all that was birthed from the Sundering came from the shards.</strong></p>
        <p>From the wound Vel'karth had torn into the heart of Time, something else festered. A shadow deeper than Night, colder than Dusk, and more ravenous than Scorch. It was not born of a phase but from envy, bitterness, and sorrow. It grew slowly, feeding on the cracks and the chaos, whispering promises to the lost and the broken.</p>
        <p>Thus, in the forgotten cradles of the world, the first seeds of the Umbra'kin were sown. They were children not of Time, but of the wound itself.</p>
        <p>The world fractured further. Time grew wild and unpredictable, like a wounded beast thrashing in its death throes. Mountains split between phases. Rivers ran backwards under alien skies. Creatures twisted to match the phase of their birth, their souls tied to the time of their making.</p>
        <p>And the Firstborn, those titans of phase and fury, began to gather followers. These children, molded in their image, would one day become the Clans.</p>
        <p><strong>Yet even then, in the earliest sagas, there were whispers.</strong></p>
        <p>Not all who were birthed of the Sundering sought war or dominion. Some, the weary and the lost, began to speak of the "Twilight Shores," a place where the phases blurred together, where the Stillness still sang.</p>
        <p>They did not know it yet, but these whisperers would be the seed of something new.</p>
        <p>A sanctum of restraint. A haven of the exiled. A covenant of those who remembered.</p>
        <p>From the forgotten roads, broken lineages, and castaway truths, the Noctara Sanctum would rise.</p>
        <p>And as the Firstborn shaped the world with flame, fang, light, and shadow, Vulmir simply watched and waited.</p>

        <p>In the aftermath of the Sundering, the world was raw and wounded. Time's broken shards bled into every horizon, birthing lands and creatures twisted by the phase that touched them most.</p>
        <p>Where Night reigned, forests of silver-barked trees loomed under skies of endless velvet, and the blood of those who lived there darkened to black. Where the Full Moon held sway, great beasts roamed in packs, their hearts thrumming with the call of the wild. Beneath the unforgiving Day, golden cities were hewn from mountains, every stone a monument to endurance and brilliance. Across the blasted plains of Scorch, rivers of fire cut jagged paths through blackened earth. And in the distant mists of Dusk, soft twilight blanketed valleys where few dared tread, save those who had forsaken the endless wars.</p>
        <p>It was in this maelstrom of broken time that the Firstborn set down roots, gathering beings attuned to their shard’s calling.</p>
        <p><strong>Cindaros</strong>, the Flame That Walks, forged the first of the flamekin tribes in the Scorch. These were creatures of molten stone and burning will. They would one day be remembered as the Scorchborne, the Titans of Flame.</p>
        <p><strong>Nyxis</strong>, the Midnight Daughter, gathered wayward souls to her side. These were scholars of shadow, warriors of the blood-veil, and dreamers too frail for the harsh light. They shaped themselves into the line that would become House Noctvaris.</p>
        <p><strong>Raelis</strong>, the Dawnforger, raised luminous citadels in the lands of Day. He called to the resilient and the daring, those who sought order amid the chaos. They would forge a lineage known as the Solari Ascendants.</p>
        <p><strong>Faelrun</strong>, the Howling Breath, surged through the wild lands of the Full Moon. His descendants became the fierce and ever-changing hunters known as the Moondrath.</p>
        <p>And <strong>Vulmir</strong>, the Pale Watcher, drew to him those who did not seek conquest. These wanderers built glades and sanctuaries, known as the Noctara Sanctum.</p>
        <p>The Scorchborne turned their gaze toward the golden cities of the Solari. Clashes erupted where Day met Scorch. Meanwhile, Noctvaris and the Moondrath fell into conflict over ideology, memory, and instinct.</p>
        <p>Through all of this, the Umbra’kin whispered. They corrupted from within, offering power for a price. Legends like <strong>Seredane of the Blazing Crest</strong> rose—and fell—becoming tragic echoes of betrayal.</p>
        <p>More names followed: <strong>Caelen the Unyielding</strong>, <strong>Vyrnissa of the Silver Veil</strong>, <strong>Braegorn, Ashen King</strong>, <strong>Ithelar, the First Duskseer</strong>. Each carved a tale into the shifting lands, but no peace endured.</p>
        <p>With time unraveling and conflict escalating, Chronoshift was no longer myth. It became the world's fractured heartbeat.</p>
        <p><strong>The Age of Endless Shifting had begun.</strong></p>
