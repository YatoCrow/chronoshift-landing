        <p>
          Chronoshift: Eclipse Dawn is a competitive strategy card game where time itself changes the battlefield. Each round can alter
          the phase of time, influencing abilities, resources, and momentum. Players choose a faction attuned to a specific
          phase like Night, Day, Full Moon, Scorch, or Dusk, and build decks that thrive under those conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every card, ability, and Conduit plays into a greater flow. Whether you prefer steady control, sudden aggression,
          or clever disruption, Chronoshift: Eclipse Dawn rewards strategic planning and bold adaptation. Time will not wait, it will
          shift. The question is, will you shift with it?
