        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: May 2025</p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy outlines how YatoCrow Games ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses,
          and safeguards data when you access the Chronoshift website and related services. We are
          committed to protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency in how information is handled.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We may collect limited, non-personal data through third-party services such as Vercel or Google Analytics.
          This may include device type, IP address, browser version, pages visited, and general location (e.g., country or region).
          We do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, or payment details
          unless you voluntarily submit them through a contact or support channel.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Collected Data</h2>
        <p>
          The data we collect is used solely for operational purposes. This includes improving site performance,
          tracking traffic patterns, and resolving technical issues. Collected data is not sold, traded, or transferred
          to third parties outside of our infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          Our site may use essential cookies to support core functionality and user experience. These cookies do not collect
          personal information and are not used for advertising or behavioral tracking. You may disable cookies through
          your browser settings, but this may affect site performance or access to certain features.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
        <p>
          The website may link to third-party services such as TheGameCrafter or external platforms like the Chronoshift Tracker App.
          We are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices of external websites. Please review their policies
          separately if you choose to interact with them.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use modern hosting infrastructure and security protocols to protect data. However, no online transmission is
          guaranteed to be fully secure. While we take reasonable precautions, users share information at their own risk.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          This site is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from minors.
          If we learn that a user under 13 has submitted personal information, we will promptly delete it from our records.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights and Contact</h2>
        <p>
          If you have any questions or concerns about how your data is handled, you may contact YatoCrow Games
          via our official communication channels. Details will be posted once our contact infrastructure is finalized.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of the website after a revision
          will signify your acceptance of the current version. We recommend checking this page periodically for updates.
